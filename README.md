# Memory Allocation

> malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), free()

A program has been devised to evaluate and contrast memory allocation strategies. Initially, memory is allocated using the calloc() function. A sequence of integers representing phone numbers is then prompted and stored in the allocated memory. Should the storage capacity be exceeded, memory reallocation is triggered to accommodate additional entries. Upon completion, the stored phone numbers are displayed. Finally, the allocated memory is freed to avoid memory leaks.

In the realm of C programming, the functions malloc() and calloc() serve as gateways to dynamic memory allocation, providing flexibility and control over memory usage. However, a common misconception often arises regarding their initialization behavior.

The behavior observed when using malloc() and calloc() is largely influenced by the current system configurations and implementations of C standard libraries. Typically, both functions return memory that is initialized to zero. This practice, though not mandated by the C standard, has become widespread among C standard library implementations.

Consequently, it's not uncommon for the initial contents of memory allocated by malloc() and calloc() to be zeros. Even after initializing them with specific values, the resultant memory blocks appear identical. This uniformity in behavior can sometimes mask the inherent differences between these allocation functions.
